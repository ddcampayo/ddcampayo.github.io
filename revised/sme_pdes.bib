                  H. Argyris. The geometrical spirit embodied in
                  Argyris’s work is revived in the sequel in applying
                  the newly developed concept of isogeometric analysis
                  to structural vibration problems. After reviewing
                  some fundamentals of isogeometric analysis,
                  application is made to several structural models,
                  including rods, thin beams, membranes, and thin
                  plates. Rotationless beam and plate models are
                  utilized as well as three-dimensional solid
                  models. The concept of k-refinement is explored and
                  shown to produce more accurate and robust results
                  than corresponding finite elements. Through the use
                  of nonlinear parameterization, “optical” branches of
                  frequency spectra are eliminated for k-refined
                  meshes. Optical branches have been identified as
                  contributors to Gibbs phenomena in wave propagation
                  problems and the cause of rapid degradation of
                  higher modes in p-method finite elements. A
                  geometrically exact model of the \{NASA\} Aluminum
                  Testbed Cylinder is constructed and frequencies and
                  mode shapes are computed and shown to compare
                  favorably with experimental results. "

    abstract = {{The requirement for stabilization or other similar techniques
                  is well known when using the finite element method in
                  computational fluid mechanics. A variety of such techniques
                  has been introduced during the past decades along with
                  different physical interpretations of the stabilization
                  terms employed. In introducing so-called information flux
                  methods, we developed a new point of view on the problem of
                  numerical instabilities; with respect to Shannon's
                  information theory instabilities are interpreted as a
                  consequence of unadequate observance of the information flux
                  present in fluid mechanics. Here we discuss different
                  approaches to setting up information flux maximum-entropy
                  approximation schemes based on that idea. The good accuracy
                  of these approximation schemes is demonstrated for
                  convection-diffusion problems by means of several linear,
                  time-independent one- and two-dimensional numerical examples

                  meshfree approximation schemes that satisfy consistency

                  functions exactly. In addition, LME approximation schemes
                  converge in the Sobolev space W1,p, i.e., they are
                  C0-continuous in the conventional terminology of
                  finite-element interpolation. Here we present a

                  Local Maximum-Entropy Approximation Schemes (HOLMES). We
                  prove uniform error bounds for the HOLMES approximates and
                  their derivatives up to order k. Moreover, we show that the
                  HOLMES of order k is dense in the Sobolev space Wk,p, for
                  any 1\^{a}{\copyright}½p<?. The good performance of HOLMES

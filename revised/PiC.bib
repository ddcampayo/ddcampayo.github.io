                  hydrodynamics. The approach uses integral form of
                  function representation and applies Taylor series
                  expansion to the \{SPH\} function and derivative
                  approximations. The constructing conditions are
                  derived systematically, which not only interpret the
                  consistency condition of the method, but also
                  describe the compact supportness requirement of the
                  smoothing function. Examples of \{SPH\} smoothing
                  function are constructed including some existing
                  ones. With this approach, a new quartic smoothing
                  function with some advantages is constructed, and is
                  applied to the one dimensional shock problem and a
                  one dimensional \{TNT\} detonation problem. The good
                  agreement between the \{SPH\} results and those from
                  other sources shows the effectiveness of the
                  approach and the newly constructed smoothing
                  function in numerical simulations. "

@article{citeulike:6829398,
    abstract = {{The requirement for stabilization or other similar techniques
                  is well known when using the finite element method in
                  computational fluid mechanics. A variety of such techniques
                  has been introduced during the past decades along with
                  different physical interpretations of the stabilization
                  terms employed. In introducing so-called information flux
                  methods, we developed a new point of view on the problem of
                  numerical instabilities; with respect to Shannon's
                  information theory instabilities are interpreted as a
                  consequence of unadequate observance of the information flux
                  present in fluid mechanics. Here we discuss different
                  approaches to setting up information flux maximum-entropy
                  approximation schemes based on that idea. The good accuracy
                  of these approximation schemes is demonstrated for
                  convection-diffusion problems by means of several linear,
                  time-independent one- and two-dimensional numerical examples

    abstract = {{Local Maximum-Entropy (LME) approximation schemes are
                  meshfree approximation schemes that satisfy consistency
                  conditions of order one, i.e., they approximate affine
                  functions exactly. In addition, LME approximation schemes
                  converge in the Sobolev space W1,p, i.e., they are
                  C0-continuous in the conventional terminology of
                  finite-element interpolation. Here we present a
                  generalization of the Local Max-Ent approximation schemes
                  that are consistent to arbitrary order, i.e., interpolate
                  polynomials of arbitrary degree exactly, and which converge
                  in Wk,p, i.e., they are Ck-continuous to arbitrary order
                  k. We refer to these approximation schemes as High Order
                  Local Maximum-Entropy Approximation Schemes (HOLMES). We
                  prove uniform error bounds for the HOLMES approximates and
                  their derivatives up to order k. Moreover, we show that the
                  HOLMES of order k is dense in the Sobolev space Wk,p, for
                  any 1\^{a}{\copyright}½p<?. The good performance of HOLMES
                  relative to other meshfree schemes in selected test cases is
                  also critically appraised.}},

\maketitle

\begin{itemize}

\item Assignment procedures, from the particles onto the mesh, are key
  for the performance of mixed Eulerian-Lagrangian simulations

\item Several known procedures are presented and assessed, including
  the well-known FLIP, along with a new one (``mass assignment'')
  which emphasizes preservation of information

\item More precisely, the assignment from the particles onto the mesh
  and back yields the same field values when the particles coincide
  with the mesh nodes

\item The procedures are tested on three scenarios: simple 1D
  convection, 2D convection of Zalesak's disk, and a CFD simulation of
  the Taylor-Green periodic vortex sheet

\item Mass assignment is seen to be clearly superior to other procedures

\end{itemize}

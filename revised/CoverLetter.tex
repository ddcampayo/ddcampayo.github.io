\opening{Dear Editor,}

We are submitting a manuscript entitled \textit{%
An assignment procedure from particles to mesh that preserves
  field values} written by Pep Espa{\~n}ol
and myself, for review and possible publication in the
\textit{International Journal for Numerical Methods in Fluids}.

We are very excited to contribute to a field in which computational
fluid dynamics meets computer graphics.  Several ``assignment''
procedures to map the information between particles and mesh are
examined, which allow combining Lagrangian and Eulerian simulations. We
identify one which is related to the standard Galerkin finite element
formulation for spatial derivatives.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Looking forward to your
reply.

\closing{Yours Faithfully,}
